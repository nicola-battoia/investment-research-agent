# Document Copilot

An internal AI chatbot that lets analysts query a corpus of documents in plain English and get sourced, citable answers.

## The client

**10-K Club** — fictional independent investment research firm. Their analysts spend half their week reading 10-Ks and 10-Qs before they can produce any original analysis. Document Copilot eats that intake work so they can skip straight to insight.

## Prerequisites

Install these before setting up `backend/` or `frontend/`:

| Tool | Version | Used for | Install |
| ---- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | 3.12+ | Backend runtime | OS package manager or python.org |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) | latest | Backend deps + `data/download.py` | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | 22+ (LTS) | Frontend toolchain and AI SDK UI | nodejs.org or `nvm install --lts` |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) | latest | Frontend package manager | `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate` |

You also need accounts/keys for external services once the app is wired up. Start with [docs/guides/supabase-setup.md](docs/guides/supabase-setup.md) (account + project), then create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) when the LLM layer is wired up.

## Running locally

To be added during the build. Setup guides:

- [Supabase](docs/guides/supabase-setup.md) — account, hosted project (dashboard or CLI)
- [Backend](docs/guides/backend-setup.md)
- [Frontend](docs/guides/frontend-setup.md)

## SEC filing ingestion

Use the standalone downloader to fetch SEC filings from EDGAR. Before downloading,
replace the placeholder contact in `data/download.py`'s `USER_AGENT`, then run:

```bash
uv run data/download.py
```

The current corpus manifest contains 27 filings: five years of 10-Ks for AAPL,
MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, and GOOGL, plus BSP's F-1 and 424B4. Downloaded and generated
payloads are gitignored.

The backend uses a custom SEC HTML parser, section-aware chunking, resumable local
embedding checkpoints, and a verified Supabase upload. Run and inspect it through
the scripts documented in
[`backend/ingestion/README.md`](backend/ingestion/README.md).
